# Eureka mutation harness: one script for every cut's mutation suite.
#
# A suite is a data file of entries; each entry is one rule a test claims to
# pin, together with the exact source change that removes the rule and the
# test that must fail while the change is applied. The harness applies one
# entry at a time, runs that test alone, restores the file from the original
# bytes, and reports a verdict per entry. Nothing here knows which cut it is
# serving.
#
#   powershell -File tools/eureka-mutations.ps1 `
#       -Entries tools/eureka-cut6b-mutations.psd1 `
#       -Target epiphany-pipeline/src/lib.rs `
#       -Test 'cargo test -p epiphany-pipeline --lib'
#
# -Entries  a `.psd1` whose root is `@{ Mutations = @(...) }`, or a `.ps1` that
#           returns the array. Paths are relative to the repo root.
# -Target   the file (or files) the suite mutates, relative to the repo root.
#           With one target every edit is against it; with more than one, each
#           edit names its `File`, which must be one of the targets.
# -Test     the cargo command that runs the suite's tests, as one string; the
#           harness appends `-- --exact <entry.Test>` per entry. An entry may
#           carry its own `Command` when its test lives in another package.
#           The string is split on whitespace with no quoting, so a command
#           or argument carrying a space (a path with a space in it) cannot be
#           expressed here.
# -TimeoutSeconds  the most one command may run, 1800 by default. A command
#           still running at the limit is killed with its process tree by the
#           harness itself, inside the entry's own restore, so a hung cargo is
#           ended by the harness rather than by whatever tool is running the
#           harness; the entry gets no verdict.
# -Repo     the repo root that `-Entries` and `-Target` are relative to and
#           that commands run from. Defaults to this script's parent, so a
#           suite in another repo names this harness and passes its own root.
#
# Entry shape: `Id`, `Rule`, `Test`, and either `Old`/`New` (with an optional
# `File`) or `Edits = @(@{ File; Old; New }, ...)`. `New = ''` deletes the
# anchor. `MustNotCompile = $true` marks an entry whose proof is a compile
# error: it is killed when the mutated tree does not build and survives when
# it does; for every other entry a tree that does not build is no verdict.
#
# Harness rules:
# - Every target is read as bytes and decoded as UTF-8; every write encodes
#   text back to bytes through one path, UTF-8 with no BOM. Windows PowerShell
#   5.1 is the interpreter on this host and its default round-trip corrupts a
#   non-ASCII literal, which fails a test on its own and fakes a kill.
# - Anchors are written with plain newlines and converted to the target's own
#   line endings before matching.
# - Every anchor must match exactly once, counting overlapping occurrences:
#   `}\n}\n` in `}\n}\n}\n` is two sites, and a splice at the first would
#   change a region the entry does not describe. Zero is a stale entry. Both
#   throw, naming the entry.
# - Restore is the original bytes written back, never a checkout, and the
#   restored file must hash to those bytes. Every write to a target, M0's
#   included, sits inside a `try` whose `finally` restores every target the
#   step touched, so a write that throws on the second target still restores
#   the first. A target that cannot be restored is printed with the words
#   RESTORE FAILED and its original SHA-256 so a human can recover it, and the
#   run throws.
# - A hard kill runs no `finally`. So before any target is written, its
#   original bytes are copied to a sidecar beside it,
#   `<target>.eureka-mutation-original`, which is deleted only after a
#   hash-verified restore. At startup, every sidecar under the repo root
#   (`target/`, `node_modules/` and `.git/` excluded), not only those of this
#   run's targets, is repaired: the file is restored from it, hash-verified,
#   and the sidecar removed, and the run prints that a previous run died
#   mid-mutation and was repaired. A file that already equals its sidecar is
#   left alone and the run says so. A file that is missing is recreated from
#   its sidecar and the run says so. A file that differs is never overwritten
#   silently: its current bytes go to `<target>.eureka-mutation-overwritten`
#   before the restore is written, and the run prints that path and its
#   SHA-256 once the restore has landed; a restore that fails without opening
#   the file removes that copy again, so it exists only when something was
#   overwritten. An existing `.eureka-mutation-overwritten` is never itself
#   clobbered: every copy is written to the first unused name in that family
#   (`.eureka-mutation-overwritten`, then `.eureka-mutation-overwritten.1`,
#   `.2`, ...), so a human's own copy and every repair's copy all survive. A
#   file that cannot be written keeps its sidecar and the run stops, naming
#   the file. A sidecar of a sidecar is not something a run leaves behind and
#   cannot be ordered against its sibling, so the run stops before any
#   repair, naming both.
# - M0 is built in and cannot be omitted: before any entry, every target's
#   bytes are decoded and re-encoded through the harness I/O path and compared
#   to the original bytes before anything is written. If a byte differs, the
#   harness is broken: the target and the first differing offset are named,
#   nothing is written and no entry runs. Only then is the target rewritten
#   through the write path and hashed; a write that lands other bytes is the
#   same verdict, with the original bytes written back first. Then every
#   command the suite uses is run bare, and a failure is the same verdict.
